    "# Automatic Differentiation with Torch.AUTOGRAD\n",
    "When trining neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm is back propagation. In this algorithm, parameters are adjucted according to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the given parameter. To compue those gradients, PyTorch has a built in differentiation engine called torch.autograd. It supports automatic computation of gradient for any computational graph. Consider the simplest one-Layer neural network, with input x, parameters w and b and some loss function. It can be defined in PyTorch in the following manner"

    "Conceptually, autograd keeps a record of data and all executed operations in a directed acyclic graph consisting of Function objects. In this DAG, leaves are the input tensors roots are the output tensors. By traching this graph from roots to leaves, you can auomatically compute the gradients using the charin rule. In a forward pass autograd does two things simultaneously: run the requested operation to compute a reauling tensor. Maintaining the operations gradient function in the DAG. The backward pass kicks off when .backward() is called on the DAG root. autograd then: computes the gradients from each .grad_fn, accumuated them in the respective tensors .grad attribute. Using the chain tule propagates all the way to the leaf tensors. \n",
